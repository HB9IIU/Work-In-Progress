# HB9IIU ISS Life Tracker
### **Efficient Real-Time Calculations on an ESP32**

This project is an **ESP32-based tracking system for the International Space Station (ISS)** that demonstrates the impressive functionality and versatility of this microcontroller. Unlike other applications that rely on external APIs to fetch the ISS's current position, this system retrieves only the **Two-Line Elements (TLEs)** and current time from online sources. All orbital calculations are performed in real time using the **SGDP4 library**, making the solution self-contained and dynamic.

The system provides detailed information about ISS passes, including **Acquisition of Signal (AOS)**, **Time of Closest Approach (TCA)**, and **Loss of Signal (LOS)**. The data is displayed on a **480x320 TFT screen** with a touchscreen interface, offering **clear and informative visualizations** such as polar plots, azimuth/elevation graphs, and satellite footprint maps. 

This project highlights how much capability can be packed into an ESP32, handling computationally intensive tasks while remaining compact and efficient.

## Description

This ESP32-based ISS tracking application combines satellite data processing, real-time visualization, 
and an intuitive user interface to deliver a robust experience. Here's how it works:

#####  Data Retrieval
- The application periodically fetches the latest Two-Line Element (TLE) data for the ISS from 
  primary and fallback APIs, ensuring up-to-date orbital calculations.

##### Pass Prediction
- Using the SGP4 library, it predicts satellite passes based on the user's geographical location, 
  calculating essential parameters such as azimuth, elevation, acquisition of signal (AOS), and loss of signal (LOS).

##### Real-Time Tracking
- The system updates ISS latitude, longitude, altitude, azimuth, and elevation data in real-time, 
  enabling live positional tracking.

##### Visual Display
- A TFT screen showcases detailed ISS information through:
  - Custom-rendered 7-segment clocks for precise time tracking.
  - Dynamic plots, including polar and azimuth-elevation graphs.
  - World map overlays with multi-pass predictions.
  - Additional contextual graphics such as the ISS orbit path and current crew data.

##### User-Friendly Features
- Smooth touchscreen navigation across multiple pages.
- Auto-refresh for critical information such as TLE updates, next-pass predictions, and ISS current position.
- Localized time calculations based on user-configured timezone and daylight saving settings.

##### Resilience & Redundancy
- Automated fallback mechanisms for network and data retrieval issues.
- TLE data is cached in flash memory, providing offline capabilities.

##### Interactive Insights
- Displays upcoming ISS passes with key metrics like duration, max elevation, and visibility times.
- Highlights conditions suitable for amateur radio communication.

### Note
All the required libraries are already included in the repository’s `lib` folder. **There is no need to install additional libraries**—this ensures that the project compiles and runs seamlessly.

## Hardware Assembly

- You will find the wiring diagram in the `doc` folder of this repository.
- The assembly process is straightforward: you simply need to wire specific pins of the ESP32 to the TFT display as shown in the diagram.
- There is **no need for a custom PCB**. The connections have been made pin-to-pin directly.
- To simplify the soldering process, you can use **Dupont cables** with their plastic housings removed. This makes handling and soldering much easier.
## 3D Printing

To enhance the usability and aesthetics of the project, I have included **all necessary STL files** for 3D printing in the `doc` folder of this repository. These files allow you to print the enclosure for your hardware, ensuring a neat and organized setup.

## Setup

1. **Copy the Repository**:  
   Download the project files from the repository:  
   [https://github.com/HB9IIU/ESP32-ISS-Tracker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/HB9IIU/ESP32-ISS-Tracker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. **Install PlatformIO**:  
   PlatformIO is the development environment used to compile and upload the code to the ESP32. Follow these steps to install it:  

   - **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:  
     Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

   - **Install the PlatformIO IDE Extension**:  
     1. Open VS Code.  
     2. Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.  
     3. Search for "**PlatformIO IDE**" and click "**Install**".  

   - **Verify Installation**:  
     1. Restart VS Code after installation.  
     2. Access PlatformIO by clicking on its icon (a small alien head) in the sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+P`.

3. **Open the Project Folder**:  
   - Unzip the downloaded repository.  
   - Open VS Code.  
   - Click on **File > Open Folder**, then select the unzipped project folder.  
   - Wait for PlatformIO to automatically download all necessary dependencies (this may take a few minutes).

4. **Configure `config.h`**:  
   To run this project successfully, you need to configure the `config.h` file by providing your specific settings for Wi-Fi, API, and observer location. Follow the instructions below:

### **Wi-Fi Configuration**  
Set up your primary and alternate Wi-Fi credentials in the `config.h` file. These settings will allow your device to connect to the network.

```cpp
// Wi-Fi configuration
const char* WIFI_SSID = "your SSID";              // Replace with your primary Wi-Fi SSID
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "your Password";      // Replace with your primary Wi-Fi password

// Alternative AP
const char* WIFI_SSID_ALT = "your alternate SSID";   // Replace with your alternate Wi-Fi SSID
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD_ALT = "your alternate Password"; // Replace with your alternate Wi-Fi password
```

---

### **API Configuration**  
The project uses the [TimeZoneDB API](https://timezonedb.com/) to fetch accurate time zone data.  
1. Visit [TimeZoneDB](https://timezonedb.com/) and create a free account.  
2. Generate your API key.  
3. Update the following line in `config.h` with your API key:  

```cpp
// API configuration
const char* TIMEZONE_API_KEY = "your API key";     // Replace with your TimeZoneDB API key
```

---

### **Observer Location**  
To ensure accurate calculations and visualizations, update the geographic location (latitude, longitude, and altitude in meters) for the observer.

```cpp
// Observer location
const double OBSERVER_LATITUDE = 0.0;     // Replace with your latitude
const double OBSERVER_LONGITUDE = 0.0;   // Replace with your longitude
const double OBSERVER_ALTITUDE = 0.0;    // Replace with your altitude in meters
```

---

### **Example `config.h` File**  
Here’s an example of a completed `config.h` file for reference:

```cpp
// Wi-Fi configuration
const char* WIFI_SSID = "MyHomeNetwork";
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "SuperSecretPassword";

// Alternative AP
const char* WIFI_SSID_ALT = "OfficeNetwork";
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD_ALT = "OfficePassword123";

// API configuration
const char* TIMEZONE_API_KEY = "ABCD1234EFGH5678"; // Example API key

// Observer location
const double OBSERVER_LATITUDE = 46.4717;      // Latitude of your location
const double OBSERVER_LONGITUDE = 6.8768;     // Longitude of your location
const double OBSERVER_ALTITUDE = 400.0;       // Altitude of your location in meters
```

---

### **Important Notes**  
- Ensure the Wi-Fi credentials and API key are accurate and match your setup.  
- Latitude and longitude values should reflect your exact location for best results. Use [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) or a GPS device to find these coordinates.  
- The altitude value must be in meters.

---

5. **Compile and Upload the Code**:  
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.  
   - In VS Code, open the **PlatformIO toolbar** (left sidebar).  
   - Click on the **"Build"** button (checkmark icon) to compile the code.  
     - If the compilation succeeds, proceed to the next step.  
   - Click on the **"Upload"** button (arrow icon) to upload the code to your ESP32.

6. **Run the Tracker**:  
   Once the code is uploaded successfully:  
   - The TFT screen will display a splash image.  
   - The ESP32 will connect to Wi-Fi and start retrieving ISS tracking data.  
   - The screen will update with real-time information about the ISS.
